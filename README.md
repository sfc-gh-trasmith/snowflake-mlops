# Snowflake MLOps Template

An open-source, production-ready template for building end-to-end ML pipelines on Snowflake. This framework provides data science teams with starter code they can plug their own model logic into, while giving ML engineering teams a standardized process for training, validating, deploying, and monitoring models — all orchestrated through Git workflows with human-in-the-loop approvals.

Use this template as a bootstrap for your MLOps workflows, or as a baseline to extend with [Cortex Code](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cortex-code/cortex-code) for more customized agentic ML and MLOps workflows.

## What This Template Covers

- **Multi-step ML Pipelines** — Snowflake Task DAG (Python SDK) with configurable compute per step (warehouse or SPCS compute pools)
- **Feature Engineering** — Snowflake Feature Store with Dynamic Tables and configurable refresh intervals
- **Model Training** — ML Jobs (`@remote`) running XGBoost on compute pools with experiment tracking
- **Quality Gates** — Automated metric thresholds (AUC-ROC, precision, recall) that block bad models from promotion
- **Model Versioning** — Auto-incremented versions in the Snowflake Model Registry with full lineage
- **CI/CD Workflows** — GitHub Actions with OIDC auth, PR checks, and environment-gated approvals
- **Model Promotion** — Two paths: code-driven (push to main) and data-driven (scheduled retrain with candidate review)
- **Batch Inference** — Model Registry `run()` on warehouse with prediction validation
- **Real-Time Inference** — SPCS containers with blue/green Gateway deployment and zero-downtime rollouts
- **Model Monitoring** — Snowflake ML Observability tracking prediction drift and feature distribution shifts
- **Rollback** — One-click revert to any previous model version
- **Scheduled Retraining** — Weekly cron with GitHub Issue notifications for human review

## How It Works

**Code-driven promotion:** feature branch → PR (lint+test) → merge to main → deploy-stage (train, validate, register) → human approval → deploy-prod (SPCS, gateway, monitor, tag)

**Data-driven promotion:** weekly cron retrains on fresh data → registers candidate in STAGE → creates GitHub Issue → human reviews → manual promote to PROD

## For Data Science Teams

Swap in your own model logic — the infrastructure stays the same:

1. **Replace the training function** in `source/pipeline/ml_pipeline_dag.py` (the `train_model()` `@remote` function)
2. **Update feature engineering** in `source/features/feature_views.py`
3. **Adjust quality gate thresholds** in `source/config.py`

Everything else (CI/CD, versioning, deployment, monitoring) works automatically.

## For ML Engineering Teams

This template provides:

- Standardized ML pipeline structure (Task DAG with configurable compute)
- Automated CI/CD with model approval gates (no model goes to PROD without human review)
- Environment isolation (DEV → STAGE → PROD as separate databases)
- Reproducible deployments (every PROD release tagged, every model version tracked)
- Rollback capability (one-click revert via GitHub Actions)

## Pipeline Flow

### Code-Driven Promotion (push to main)

1. **PR Checks** — Ruff linting and unit tests run automatically on every pull request
2. **Merge to main** — Triggers the deploy workflow
3. **Deploy Task DAG** — Creates/updates Snowflake Tasks using the Python SDK
4. **Execute Pipeline** — Runs three ML Jobs sequentially on the compute pool:
   - Feature Engineering (registers Feature Views from raw data)
   - Model Training (XGBoost with cross-validation, logs to Experiment Tracking)
   - Evaluation (computes metrics, writes to PIPELINE_RESULTS table)
5. **Quality Gate** — Checks AUC-ROC, precision, and recall against configured thresholds. If any threshold is missed, the workflow fails and the model is NOT registered.
6. **Register Model** — Only if the quality gate passes. Auto-increments version (V1 → V2 → V3) in the STAGE Model Registry. Emits the blessed version to the workflow for promotion. Does NOT touch PROD yet.
7. **Batch Inference Validation** — Scores the Feature View table using `model.run()` on the warehouse. Validates predictions are sane (no nulls, probabilities sum to 1.0). Writes results to `BATCH_PREDICTIONS` for monitoring.
8. **Monitor Validation** — Creates a ModelMonitor in STAGE, verifies it reaches ACTIVE state, then drops it (proves PROD setup will succeed)
9. **Human Approval** — Workflow pauses. Reviewer sees metrics in the Job Summary and approves PROD deployment.
10. **PROD Deployment:**
    - **Promote model** — replicates the exact gated version from STAGE to PROD (no re-resolution), sets as DEFAULT
    - Registers Feature Views in PROD
    - **Batch inference** — validates `model.run()` works in PROD
    - **Real-time inference** — deploys SPCS container service (blue/green), shifts Gateway traffic to new version
    - Sets up persistent ModelMonitor (tracks prediction drift daily)
    - Tags release: `prod/V3-20260812-...`

### Data-Driven Promotion (scheduled retrain)

1. **Weekly cron fires** (Monday 6AM PT) — or manually triggered
2. **Same pipeline runs** — Feature Eng → Train → Evaluate on fresh data
3. **STAGE_ONLY mode** — Model is registered in STAGE but NOT promoted to PROD
4. **GitHub Issue created** — "Model Candidate Ready: V4" with metrics table
5. **Human reviews** the issue, decides whether to promote
6. **Manual promote** — Run the deploy workflow with `promote_only=true` and specify the `model_version` (e.g., `V4`), approve PROD deployment

### Rollback

Manual dispatch of the rollback workflow: sets DEFAULT version back, redeploys SPCS service, validates gateway.

## Snowflake Services Used

| Component | Service |
|-----------|---------|
| Pipeline Orchestration | Tasks (Python SDK DAG) |
| Feature Engineering | Feature Store (Dynamic Tables) |
| Model Training | ML Jobs (`@remote` on Compute Pools) |
| Experiment Tracking | ExperimentTracking API |
| Model Versioning | Model Registry |
| Batch Inference | Model Registry `run()` on warehouse |
| Real-Time Serving | SPCS containers + Gateway |
| Model Monitoring | ML Observability (ModelMonitor) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions with OIDC (zero secrets) |

## Prerequisites

- Snowflake account with `ACCOUNTADMIN` role (for initial setup; CI uses `MLOPS_STAGE_ROLE` and `MLOPS_PROD_ROLE`)
- Python 3.12+ with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed
- [Snowflake CLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index) (`snow`) installed and configured
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed
- GitHub repository (public, for environment protection rules)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/snowflake-mlops.git
cd snowflake-mlops
uv sync
```

### 2. Create Snowflake Infrastructure

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

Creates three environments (`SNOW_MLOPS_DEV`, `SNOW_MLOPS_STAGE`, `SNOW_MLOPS_PROD`) with databases, warehouses, compute pools, and stages.

### 3. Generate Sample Data

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_dataset.py
```

Creates 100K synthetic fraud transactions (~3% fraud rate) in `SNOW_MLOPS_PROD.ML`.

### 4. Deploy and Run the Pipeline (DEV)

```bash
# Deploy the Task DAG
uv run python source/pipeline/ml_pipeline_dag.py --deploy --env dev

# Execute (triggers Feature Eng → Training → Evaluation)
uv run python source/pipeline/ml_pipeline_dag.py --execute --env dev

# Check status
uv run python source/pipeline/ml_pipeline_dag.py --status --env dev
```

### 5. Set Up CI/CD

```bash
bash scripts/setup_cicd.sh
```

This creates OIDC service users (`SVC_GITHUB_ACTIONS_STAGE`, `SVC_GITHUB_ACTIONS`) for passwordless CI authentication, plus two roles:
- **`MLOPS_STAGE_ROLE`** — used by STAGE workflows (DEV + STAGE access, read-only on PROD)
- **`MLOPS_PROD_ROLE`** — used by PROD workflows (PROD access, BIND SERVICE ENDPOINT)

Then configure your GitHub repo (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables tab**):

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` | Your Snowflake account identifier | `MYORG-MYACCOUNT` |
| `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE_STAGE` | STAGE database name | `SNOW_MLOPS_STAGE` |
| `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE_PROD` | PROD database name | `SNOW_MLOPS_PROD` |
| `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA` | Schema (shared across envs) | `ML` |
| `SNOWFLAKE_USER_STAGE` | OIDC service user for STAGE | `SVC_GITHUB_ACTIONS_STAGE` |
| `SNOWFLAKE_USER_PROD` | OIDC service user for PROD | `SVC_GITHUB_ACTIONS` |
| `TOPOLOGY` | Promotion strategy | `single-account` |
| `ENABLE_MODEL_MONITOR` | Enable monitoring in PROD (optional) | `true` |

Then create **GitHub Environments** (**Settings → Environments**):
- **`STAGE`** — no protection rules
- **`PROD`** — add a required reviewer (this creates the human approval gate)

### 6. Test End-to-End

```bash
# Create a feature branch, make a change, push
git checkout -b feature/my-change
# ... modify model logic, features, or config ...
git add -A && git commit -m "Update model" && git push -u origin feature/my-change

# Create PR → lint+test run → merge → deploy-stage → approve → deploy-prod
gh pr create --title "My model update"
```

## Configuration

Everything is configurable from `source/config.py`:

```python
# Compute mode per pipeline step
"feature_engineering_compute": "spcs",  # or "warehouse"
"training_compute": "spcs",
"evaluation_compute": "spcs",

# Feature View refresh
"customer_features_refresh": "1 hour",

# Scheduled retraining
"schedule": "USING CRON 0 6 * * MON America/Los_Angeles",

# Quality gate thresholds
MIN_AUC_ROC = 0.85
MIN_PRECISION = 0.70
MIN_RECALL = 0.60
```

### ML Runtime Dependencies

Training and serving dependency versions are pinned in `pyproject.toml` under the `[dependency-groups] ml-runtime` group:

```toml
ml-runtime = ["xgboost==3.3.0", "scikit-learn==1.6.1"]
```

This ensures the ML Job (training on SPCS) and the Model Registry (serving environment) always use the same library versions. To update:

1. Edit the versions in `pyproject.toml`
2. Run `uv lock`
3. Commit — both training and serving automatically pick up the new versions

To install locally for development: `uv sync --group ml-runtime`

## CI/CD Workflows

| Trigger | What Happens | Human Approval |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| PR to `main` | Lint + unit tests | Merge requires passing checks |
| Push to `main` | Train → quality gate → register → batch inference → PROD deploy | Required for PROD |
| Weekly cron | Retrain on fresh data → register candidate → GitHub Issue | Manual promote via `promote_only` |
| Manual dispatch | Promote existing candidate or full retrain | Required for PROD |
| Rollback dispatch | Revert PROD to previous version | Immediate |

## Extending This Template

**Add a new pipeline step:**
1. Add `"new_step_compute": "spcs"` to `PIPELINE_CONFIG`
2. Create a `build_new_step_remote(cfg)` function in `ml_pipeline_dag.py`
3. Add `DAGTask("NEW_STEP", definition=func)` and wire dependencies

**Switch to a different model:**
1. Replace the training logic in `build_train_model_remote()`
2. Update feature columns and Feature View SQL
3. Adjust quality gate thresholds

**Add multi-account support:**
1. Implement `deploy/strategies/multi_account.py` with a `promote(version, session)` function
2. Set `TOPOLOGY=multi-account` in GitHub variables
